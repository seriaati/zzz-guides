        using her most important skills. and on top of that at max stacks it

    - title: Sheer Damage and Crit Rate VS Crit DMG
    - description: |
        Sheer Damage completely ignores OEF so PEN isnt on
        Yixuan.

        Yixuan with her signature only needs 68% CR to reach CR
        in combat.

        Generally use 2-Pc Woodpecker to balance Crit Ratio especially
        without Signature Engine.

      description: |
        Nicole and Rina are not good teammates for Yixuan as Sheer Damage ignores all
        DEF. All ATK buffers are good for Yixuan despite her scaling off of HP as Sheer
        converts 30% of your ATK into Sheer Force. For example Lucy's 600 ATK will
        convert to 180 Sheer Force. Nicole “could” be used for her Ether DMG%, CR% and
        W-Engine buff if you really lack options but this is not worth it or recommended at
        all. Since this isn't a good use of Nicole and another team would want her more.
