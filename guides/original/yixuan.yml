  - name: Qingming Birdcage
    description: |
      **Best in Slot in all situations**, has a **HP% Main Stat**, **in-combat Crit Rate**, 
      gives **stacking Ether DMG% Bonus** and **Ether Sheer DMG% Bonus** for <special> **EX Special & <chain> Ultimate**, 
      her two highest damaging abilities
  - name: Any S Rank Crit Rate W-Engine
    description: |
      **Any Crit Rate Main Stat** and **high Base ATK** W-Engine will
      be good due to Yixuan's **Rupture Specialty passive ATK stat conversion**, even with
      no passive from the W-Engine itself
  - name: Radiowave Journey
    description: |
      Best A Rank option due to having a **HP% Main Stat** but requires
      the Battle Pass, when using a <chain> **Chain Attack** or **Ultimate**, gain a
      **Sheer Force Stat Boost** which can **stack up to 3 times**
  - name: Puzzle Sphere
    description: |
      The 2nd best option following closely behind Radiowave Journey, providing a **Crit DMG Boost** for 12s upon using <special> **EX Special**
      and on top of that, if the enemy is at or **below 50% HP** they will **recieve more DMG** from said <special> **EX Special**, a respectable choice, even better than
      Radiowave Journery when Puzzle Sphere is at S5

        The best and currently only option for Yixuan. tailor made for her kit

        Its 2-Pc bonus gives **HP%** which is desired for Yixuan and its 4-Pc
        effect gives a **stacking Crit Rate Bonus up to 12%** from simply
        using her most important skills. and on top of that at max stacks it
        gives you a **Sheer DMG bonus**
  two_pieces:
    - name: Branch & Blade Song / Woodpecker Electro
      description: |
        The two best 2-Pc options for Yixuan. always being a damage
        increase but your pick will depend on if you have her signature or
        not

    - title: Sheer Damage and Crit Rate VS Crit DMG
      description: |
        **Sheer Damage completely ignores DEF** so PEN isnt needed on
        Yixuan.

        Yixuan with her **signature W-Engine only needs 68% Crit Rate** to reach
        **100% Crit Rate in combat**.

        Generally use 2-Pc Woodpecker to **balance Crit Ratio** especially
        without Signature Engine. If you have well rolled Disc pieces go Branch & Blade

skills:
  - title: "EX Special Attack: Cloud-Shaper"
    description: |
      ### With enough Adrenaline, hold <basic> to activate:

      Continuously charge up, **channeling energy around enemies** to deal DMG over
      time, up to a max of 2s, **dealing massive Auric Ink DMG**.

      At the **moment the skill is activated, a <dodge> Perfect Dodge can be triggered**.
      After the Perfect Dodge, enter the **Vital View** state.
    explanation: |
      Best used during the **Stun Window** after using your <chain> **Ultimate** due to
      dealing **30% Extra DMG to Stunned enemies** and the **40% Crit DMG Boost** from <core> **Additional Core Passive**.
  - title: "EX Special Attack: Ink Manifestation"
    description: |
      ### With enough Adrenaline, press or hold <special> to activate:

      Charge continuously, and press or release <special> to launch an upward wing attack, **dealing massive Auric Ink DMG**.

      **While charging, incoming attacks are automatically blocked and will activate the upward wing attack**.
      If **hit** at the **exact moment charging begins or the button is pressed**, it triggers a **Perfect Block effect**, negating the DMG, **dealing more damage** and **recovering 10 Adrenaline**.

      After the skill, press <special> to launch <special> **EX Special Attack: Celestial Cloud Blitz - Break**.

      After <special> **EX Special Attack: Celestial Cloud Blitz - Break**, and **with enough Adrenaline**, press <special> to consume **another 20 Adrenaline** to launch <special> **EX Special Attack: Qingming Eruption - Break**.
    explanation: |
      **Initial attack** best used to **parry incoming attacks** to **regenerate Adrenaline** for Yixuan and **deal more damage**,
      follow up attacks should be used to **stack up Technique Points**
  - title: "Basic Attack: Auric Array & Basic Attack: Ink - Veil Cloud Coalescence"
    description: |
      ### While possessing an Auric Ink Point, hold <dodge> to activate:

      Deploy an array, **continuously dealing Auric Ink DMG**.

      While channeling, **continuously recover Adrenaline**, **recovering 7 points per second**, for up to 3s.
    explanation: |
      Typical used with either a **Swap Cancel** or **after a Stun window** to **regenerate Adrenaline**.
      this move can be used **without an Auric Ink Point** but **without the regeneration effect and lower damage**, great value when **Swap Canceling** though
  - title: "Ultimate: Qingming Skyshade & Ultimate: Endless Talisman Suppression"
    description: |
      ### When Decibel Rating is at Maximum / With enough Technique Points, press <chain> to activate:

      Launch a barrage of wing attacks, then guide countless talismans to attack, **dealing massive Auric Ink DMG**.
      Upon activating this skill, Yixuan evenly **redistributes the squad's HP** / **Gain an Auric Ink Point**
    explanation: |
      Yixuan has access to two <chain> **Ultimate** attacks, one **consuming Decibels** and the other **consuming Technique Points**, when you are **in possesion of both Max Decibels and Technique Points**,
      the **Technique Points version of her <chain> Ultimate will activate first**.
      You should aim to activate both <chain> **Ultimates** in a **single Stun window**. Using Yixuan's <chain> **Ultimate will give you a 40% Crit Damage Boost for 15s through her <core> Additional Core Passive**.

    - title: Extra Notes on Team Building
      description: |
        **Nicole and Rina** are **not good teammates** for Yixuan as **Sheer Damage ignores all
        DEF** making their buffs useless. All **ATK buffers are good** for Yixuan despite her scaling off of HP as **Rupture Passive
        converts 30% of your ATK into Sheer Force**. For example Lucy's 600 ATK will
        convert to 180 Sheer Force. Nicole “could” be used for her Ether DMG%, CR% and
        W-Engine buff if you really lack options but this is not worth it or recommended at
        all. Since this isn't a good use of Nicole and another team would want her more.
