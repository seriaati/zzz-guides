  who is part of the **Stars of Lyra faction**.
weapons:
  - name: Elegant Vanity
    description: |
      **Best in Slot in all situations**, provides Astra with **Energy Regeneration**, a **stacking 10% DMG Boost** for the whole
      team and a massive **30% ATK Main Stat** to help her with reaching her <core> **Core Passive Requirement**, but due to the
      strength of A Rank Support W-Engine's, this W-Engine is somewhat overkill and Astra can reach full potential without it
  - name: Bashful Demon
    description: |
      The best peforming A Rank W-Engine for Astra, providing a generous **3.2% Combat ATK% boost** that **stacks up to 4 times**
      at S5 while having a **ATK% Main Stat** to help out with Astra's <core> **Core Passive requirement** making it all around the best
  - name: Kaboom the Cannon
    description: |
      The 2nd best A Rank W-Engine for Astra, almost has the exact same passive bonuses as Bashful Demon but requires way more
      careful play to maximise it, requiring constant **Quick Assists** to keep it's effect up, it also doesn't have access to a **ATK%
      Main Stat** making it harder to fulfill Astra's <core> **Core Passive requirement** but still a servicable option if you don't
      have Bashful Demon

    - name: Astral Voice
      description: |
        Astral Voice was simply made for Astra, she has no issue mainting it's **Quick Assist** requirement, making her
        have full uptime on it's **24% DMG Boost** at all times
  two_pieces:
    - name: Swing Jazz
      description: |
        Her best 2-Pc set, gives a very needed **20% Energy Regen bonus** helping her **Quick Assist** more often
    - name: Hormone Punk
      description: |
        A potential option for people running Kaboom the Cannon that need more ATK% to reach Astra's
        <core> **Core Passive** requirement

      description: |
        Astra Yao needs **atleast 3429 BASE ATK** to fulfill her <core> **Core Passive** requirement, this should be your **highest priority**
        After getting 3429 ATK you should focus on getting as much Energy Regen as possible with Min/Maxing stats, the
        more ER% you have the more **Quick Assists** you can trigger which will make your rotations easier with Astra on the team

    Her <special> **EX Special** has the highest priority for upgrades due to **increasing everyones DMG and Crit DMG** up to 
    **20% and 25% respectively** while her <chain> **Ultimate** will simply provide **more healing** and more chip damage
