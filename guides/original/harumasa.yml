    - name: Shadow Harmony
      description: |
        4-Pc Shadow Harmony is the most consistent due to it not being reliant on Shock anomaly or Hormone Punk's uptime to do the most damage. The set gives everything Harumasa needs on top of
        it's near 100% uptime. At max stacks (which will be surely after your burst starts) you will gain:

        15% Dash Attack DMG Bonus
        12% Combat ATK Boost
        12% Crit Rate

        The other sets have their uses in Mono-shock team and/or Shiyu Defense Speedrun.
    - name: Hormone Punk

        The best 4-Pc set for high burst DMG builds outside of Rina Mono Shock Teams, on top of it's 2-Pc 10% ATK bonus it grants a massive 25% Combat ATK Bonus when swapped on field when it's not
        on cooldown for 10 seconds

        Especially the best when you do not need the Crit boost from 4-Pc Shadow Harmony to reach 100%~ Crit Rate with Dash Attacks

        ATK% Disc 5 is better than Elec% Disc 5, especially with his Signature giving him bonus Elec% on Dash attack. A good Elec% disc can still outperform a bad ATK% disc, so it is recommended
        to pick the disc with the best sub stats.

        His Enhanced Dash Attack gets 25% Crit Rate bonus, making the max Crit Rate 75%, further reduced by 12% from 4-Pc Shadow Harmony, 15% from M6 Nicole, 20% from Signature W-Engine, and
        more depending on the setup.

  - title: "Dash Attack: Hiten no Tsuru - Slash"
    description: |
      While there are X-Marked enemies on the field, Harumasa will enter the Awakened state, switching Dash Attack: Hiten no Tsuru for Dash Attack: Hiten no Tsuru - Slash.

      Rush forwards to the closest X-Marked enemy and execute a powerful slash, dealing Electric DMG.
      When the slash hits the target, it consumes 2 stacks of Electro Prison.
      repeatedly press DASH ATTACK to repeatedly use Dash Attack: Hiten no Tsuru - Slash.
    explanation: |
      Best used during the stun window due to Harumasa dealing 40% more DMG to stunned or anomaly inflicted enemies

    description: |
      Harumasa's M1 is a great extender for his burst dps windows allowing more stacks from your basic attack and your quivers shooting another arrow at the target. Allowing for some lethal
      setups with increased stacks and marks on the opponent. It is also a good mindscape for On-field Harumasa as it extends his dash attack combo further.
