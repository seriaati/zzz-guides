    description: Perfect synergy with Ye Shunguang as it provides a huge CDMG% boost on top of DMG% and Phys Res ignore.
    title: Best W-Engine
  - name: The Brimstone
    description: At low copy levels a somewhat mediocre option but scales excellently at higher levels due to most of Ye Shunguang's attacks during Enlightened Mind State being from basic attacks although you have to use more in-air basic attacks to ramp stacks faster. At max copies this W-Engine performs close to her Signature. Make sure to run CMDG% in Slot 4 of Disk Drives.
    title: Good Scaling
  - name: Severed Innocence
    description: A good stat sick due to purely being CDMG% and no CRATE%.
    title: Best Limited Non-Signature W-Engine
  - name: Steel Cushion
    description: A good alternative incase you do not own The Brimstone due to high base stats and Phys DMG%. Make sure to run CMDG% in Slot 4 of Disk Drives.
